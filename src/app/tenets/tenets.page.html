          <h2>Preamble</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Halal</b> - permitted; <b>haram</b> – prohibited; <b>makrooh</b> – questionable to detestable.
          </p>
          <p>
              Halal food is based on Islamic dietary law derived from the Quran, Hadith (the practices of the Prophet Mohammad), Ijma (a consensus of legal opinion), and Qiyas (reasoning by analogy) (Regenstein, Chaudry & Regenstein, 2003; Adekunle, 2019):
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Prohibition of animals</li>
           <li>Prohibition of blood</li>
           <li>Method of slaughtering/blessing</li>
           <li>Prohibition of carrion</li>
           <li>Prohibition of intoxicants</li>

          </ul>
        </ion-slide>

        <ion-slide>
          <p>According to the Quran, all things created by Allah is permissible <b>EXCEPT</b> pork, blood, meat of animals that died of causes other than proper slaughtering, food that has been dedicated or immolated to someone other than Allah, alcohol, intoxicants, and inappropriately used drugs (Quran II:172; Quran II:168; Quran XX:81). Healthy eating is also a very important part of halal laws.  Specifically prohibited items are:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Carrion, blood and swine flesh.</li>
            <li>Food dedicated unto any other than Allah (God).</li>
            <li>Strangled animals.</li>
            <li>Dead animals through beating.</li>
            <li>The dead through falling from height.</li>
            <li>Killed by goring of horns.</li>
            <li>Devoured by wild beasts except made lawful by scholars/blessing.</li>
            <li>Food immolated to idols</li>
            <li>1-8 (Quran V:3)</li>
            <li>Inappropriately used drugs (Regenstein, Chaudry & Regenstein, 2003; Adekunle, 2019).</li>
          </ol>

          <p> 
              There are 11 generally accepted principles (as presented by Regenstein, Chaudry & Regenstein, 2003):
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>All things created by Allah are permitted with a few exceptions.</li>
            <li>To make lawful and unlawful is the prerogative of almighty God.</li>
            <li>Prohibiting what is permissible or permitting what is prohibited is like putting others at the same level with God. </li>
            <li>Impurities and harmfulness are the basic reasons for prohibition.</li>
            <li>The permitted foods are enough for nutritious and healthy living.</li>
            <li>Prohibition is because it is not appropriate.</li>
            <li>The representation of unlawful as lawful is prohibited no matter the justification.</li>
            <li>Good intentions will never make haram to be halal.</li>
            <li>Doubtful (questionable to detestable) food should be avoided.</li>
            <li>The laws are universally applicable to all races, sexes and creeds. No discrimination whatsoever.</li>
            <li>Finally, necessity allows exceptions. Prohibited foods can ensure survival - in other words, they can be consumed only when it is a "do or die" affair.</li>
          </ol>
